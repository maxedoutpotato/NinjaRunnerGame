## 📝 Project Narrative

This game was developed as a personal project to deepen my understanding of web-based game development. My primary goal was to handle the entire creative pipeline myself, from the initial concept sketches to the final line of code. Every visual and audio asset in this game—including character sprites, animations, backgrounds, and music—was created by me. Some of the sound effects are from the internet . It was a fantastic challenge for art, animation, and coding.
